# METHOD--

# 1) Find all possible permutations of the given array.

# 2) Print the Next permutation right after the er given input sequence.


# Time Complexity: O(N * N!), N represents the number of elements present in the input sequence. represent all possible permutation. Therefore, It takes the time complexity O(N*N!).
                            
# Auxiliary Space: O(N), for storing the permutation in some data structure.
